## How to contribute to ScalaMock

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Help with the ScalaMock source code**

* Have a look at the open issues to see what needs improving.

* Fork the ScalaMock repository to get a copy of the repo that you can push back to

* Once you have your code and tests working, open a new GitHub pull request back to the main repository with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Improve the code quality - or - to quote Uncle Bob: "Leave the campground cleaner than the way you found it."

#### **Do you have a request or idea for a new feature?**

* Open a new issue to discuss your idea with others and get some feedback. Before doing do, please search the GitHub issues to find out if someone suggested something similar already.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the documentation?**

* https://scalamock.org is automatically generated from the `gh-pages` [branch](https://github.com/paulbutcher/ScalaMock/tree/gh-pages). You can submit a Pull Request against it if you want to contribute.

#### **Help other ScalaMock users**

Or, if working with the source code is not for you, why not help out on stackoverflow, and help people there? Have a look at the [tagged questions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scalamock).

ScalaMock is a volunteer effort. So sometimes, problems can take a while to get resolved as we can only work on the project in our spare time.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
